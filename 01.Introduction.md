## What is Ansible?  

Ansible is a powerful IT automation tool that automates tasks like provisioning,
configuration management, Continuous Delivery, Application Deployment and Security Compliance. 
This is simple, powerful and agentless.   

Ansible is agentless i.e., we don't need to install any additional software on the target machines 
to be able to work with ansible. A simple SSH connectivity should be sufficient for ansible needs.
